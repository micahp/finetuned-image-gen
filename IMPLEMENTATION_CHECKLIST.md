### **Code Quality Standards**
- **Zero tolerance for 'any' types**: All interfaces properly typed
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Custom error classes for different scenarios
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests first, implement features second
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Consistent code formatting and best practices

### **Cost Optimization Strategy**
- Start with free tiers (Vercel, Together AI)
- Use your Contabo server for PostgreSQL and image storage
- Cloudflare for CDN and DNS (free tier)
- Scale infrastructure as revenue grows
