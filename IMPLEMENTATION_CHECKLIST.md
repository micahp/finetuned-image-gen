## üîß **Development Commands Reference**

```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Database operations
npm run db:migrate      # Run migrations
npm run db:generate     # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:studio       # Open Prisma Studio

# Testing
npm test               # Run all tests
npm run test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # Run with coverage report

# Build and deploy
npm run build          # Build for production
npm run start          # Start production server
npm run lint           # Lint codebase
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions**

### **Why This Tech Stack?**
- **Next.js 14**: Full-stack framework with App Router for modern development
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database access with excellent migration tools
- **Together AI**: Cost-effective FLUX models with LoRA fine-tuning
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management, easier than Redux
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid UI development

### **Database Design Rationale**
- **Separate UserModels table**: Allows multiple models per user
- **Training/Generated image separation**: Different storage and lifecycle needs
- **JobQueue table**: Essential for background processing of AI operations
- **Subscription tracking**: Built-in billing support from day one

### **Cost Optimization Strategy**
- Start with free tiers (Vercel, Together AI)
- Use your Contabo server for PostgreSQL and image storage
- Cloudflare for CDN and DNS (free tier)
- Scale infrastructure as revenue grows

## üìä **Success Metrics to Track**

### **Technical Metrics**
- [ ] API response times < 200ms
- [ ] Image generation success rate > 95%
- [ ] Model training completion rate > 90%
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%

### **Business Metrics**
- [ ] User registration rate
- [ ] Model creation completion rate
- [ ] Image generation per user
- [ ] Subscription conversion rate
- [ ] Monthly recurring revenue

### **User Experience Metrics**
