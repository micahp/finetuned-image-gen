const trainingService = new TrainingService()

// Start training
const result = await trainingService.startTraining({

  triggerWord: 'mycustom',
  description: 'My custom LoRA model',
  trainingImages: uploadedImages, // From your existing upload system
  userId: session.user.id,

})

// Monitor progress
const status = await trainingService.getTrainingStatus(
  result.trainingId, 
  'my-custom-model'

console.log(status.status)     // 'starting' | 'training' | 'uploading' | 'completed' | 'failed'
console.log(status.progress)   // 0-100
console.log(status.debugData)  // Complete debug information
```
